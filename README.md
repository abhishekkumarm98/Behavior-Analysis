# Behavior-Analysis
Understanding CUES using NLP approaches for behavior analysis.

The motivation is to help subject by modifying an ingrained behavior by measuring and improving their ability to delay gratification. Delayed discounting  is a way to measure the ability to delay gratification, and the longer one can delay, the more likely they are to be able to succeed in attaining their behavior modification goals. We are applying NLP approaches to identify words or concepts that improve delayed discount.

â—¦  For example, if a person is offered $10 today or a week from now, then there is a high probability that he/she will take the money today rather than waiting for a week. Similarly, in subsequent step, the same person is offered $7 tomorrow or 4 days from now then he/she is most likely to wait for one day to get money. So, the behavior changes and it gets regulated even if someone has to wait for more duration.
